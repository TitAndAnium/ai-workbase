# Prompt: Tone Tweaker

## 🔍 What it does
This prompt rewrites any block of text into a different tone of voice (e.g. casual, witty, corporate, confident, warm, serious). It's used to align outputs with brand voice, persona, or audience language — without altering core content.

## 🧠 Why I use it
This is my default utility to match tone without losing message. I use it for landing pages, product copy, job posts, LinkedIn updates, AI assistants — anywhere tone matters.

## 📥 Input Format

```
Text: [Paste your text here]
Tone: [Desired tone: casual, witty, corporate, warm, confident, etc.]
```

## 🪄 The Prompt

```
You are a professional copywriter. Rewrite the following text using a {Tone} tone of voice. Keep the meaning and structure intact, but shift the style to match the tone.

Text: {Text}
```

## 💡 Usage Tips
- Works well in prompt chains and agent workflows
- Add a persona context if tone isn’t enough (e.g. “a luxury brand copywriter”)
- Combine with instruction-focused prompts for better results
- Always A/B test tone output on your target reader
