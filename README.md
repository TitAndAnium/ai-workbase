# 🧠 AI Workbase – Prompt Playground & Builder Toolkit

This is my personal AI workbase: a growing, public-first repository where I document, test, structure and showcase my own logic around prompts, copy-assistants, validators, agents and everything in between. Think of this as my thinking-in-code space — messy at times, but real and reusable.

## 🎯 What this repo is (and isn’t)

**This is not** a polished product or something that’s being shipped.  
**This is** my AI builder brain, made visible.

It’s the place where I:
- Develop, break and rebuild my own prompt patterns  
- Capture logic I want to reuse across future tools, agents, or experiments  
- Learn and document insights while going through AI certifications or test cases  
- Build foundational utilities like tone switchers, copy assistants, tag validators, persona writers  
- Tweak and version prompts in an open, collaborative and structured way

## 💡 Why I use GitHub for this

Because I don’t want this work hidden in screenshots, chats or Notion dumps.  
Because structure leads to clarity.  
And because if it ever helps someone else — cool. If not, it at least helps *me* think sharper, build smarter, and grow consistently.

## 🚀 What’s in here?

Right now, you’ll find:
- `samples/`: before-after examples of prompt effects  
- `functions/`: standalone logic blocks or utilities I may plug into other tools  
- `agents/`: experiments with persona-based assistants and their system prompts  
- Ongoing work on flows like `gift-mode-copy-assistant`, tag improvement agents and tone control utilities

## 🔄 What’s coming later?

As I move through different AI certification tracks and tool explorations, I’ll add:
- LangChain or RAG prompt studies  
- No-code logic blocks for Zapier/Make  
- Strategic GPTs for Brand Bazen or client-specific flows  
- Embedded prompt validators  
- Meta-experiments comparing GPT vs Claude vs Gemini  
- Possibly a published `@tayfun/prompt-utils` module for personal reuse or community release

## ✍️ My voice, my way

You’ll notice that this isn’t written in a corporate style. That’s intentional.  
It’s *mine*. Conversational. Direct. A bit rough at times. But built to last — and evolve.
