# Use Case: Gift Mode Copy Assistant

## 🎯 What it is

A reusable prompt engine that generates rich, emotionally resonant product descriptions tailored for Etsy’s Gift Mode algorithm. It helps Etsy sellers turn product features into story-driven copy that actually resonates with real people — not just SEO.

## 💡 Why I built this

Etsy’s Gift Mode shift makes generic product descriptions obsolete. You need words that *feel* like a gift. This module lets me:

And honestly? It’s just fun to watch simple input transform into storytelling copy.
