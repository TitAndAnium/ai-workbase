# 🎁 Use Case: Gift Mode Description Generator

## 🔍 What it does
Generates a rich, markdown-formatted product description tailored for Etsy's **Gift Mode** using structured input. It highlights tone, style, features, and extras — making listings more appealing and compliant with Etsy's formatting preferences.

## 🧠 Why I use it
Because Etsy buyers respond to structured, emotionally relevant descriptions — especially in gift scenarios. This script lets me generate repeatable, high-quality markdown blocks that plug directly into my listings or tooling.

## ⚙️ How it works
- Accepts structured input with `productType`, `recipient`, `occasion`, `tone`, `style`, `features[]`, and optional `callouts[]`
- Includes fallback defaults for robustness
- Requires **at least two features** to return valid output
- Returns markdown block with `Overview`, `Features`, and optional `Bonus Details`

## 📥 Input Format
```json
{
  "productType": "crewneck sweatshirt",
  "recipient": "bride-to-be",
  "occasion": "wedding",
  "tone": "warm",
  "style": "minimalist",

    "Soft fleece lining for all-season wear"
  ],
  "callouts": [

    "Perfect for engagement photos, bridal showers, honeymoon"
  ]
}
```
