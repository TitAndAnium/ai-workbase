# AI Automation Playbooks

Not fancy. Just functional.

This folder contains modular AI automation workflows I use or prototype â€” think: multi-step GPT pipelines, integrated tools like Notion, Airtable, Zapier, Claude, Make, Typeform, Google Sheets, or custom endpoints.

Everything here is:
- Battle-tested (or actively battle-tested)
- System-first (no fluff, no AI-for-the-sake-of-AI)
- Easy to fork, reuse or adapt
