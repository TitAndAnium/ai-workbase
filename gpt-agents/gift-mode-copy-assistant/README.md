# 🛍️ Gift Mode Copy Assistant

This module generates rich, markdown-formatted Etsy listing descriptions based on structured input data. It's designed to align with Etsy's Gift Mode visibility algorithms by emphasizing emotional context, features, and buyer intent.

## 🔍 What it does

- Transforms structured JSON product data into a complete Etsy listing description
- Matches Etsy’s formatting conventions (`::: Overview :::`, `::: Features :::`, etc.)
